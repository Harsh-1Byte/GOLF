**Project Title: Early Warning System for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) using Remote Sensing, IoT Sensors, and Machine Learning**

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop an advanced Early Warning System (EWS) for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) using remote sensing data, IoT sensors, and machine learning algorithms. With the increasing threat of GLOFs due to climate change, the system will monitor critical indicators such as lake size, water level, temperature, flow rates, and dam stability. By analyzing real-time data from a network of sensors, the system will detect early signs of potential dam failure and flooding, providing vital lead time for evacuation and mitigation efforts. The project will enhance disaster preparedness, reduce economic losses, and improve infrastructure resilience in glacial regions.
